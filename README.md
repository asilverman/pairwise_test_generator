# PTG - Pairwise TestCase Generator
PTG is a python application that automatically generates test case matrices. PTG implements the algorithm presented by Jaceck Czerwonka in his paper [Pairwise Testing in the Real World: Practical Extensions to Test-Case Scenarios](https://github.com/Microsoft/pict/blob/master/doc/Pairwise%20Testing%20in%20Real%20World.pdf) and aims to implement and extend the functionality provided by Microsoft(R) PICT through a pythonic implementation that is code readable and thoroughly documented.

The motivation for PTG is based on my personal curiosity for the pairwise testing methodology and the development of my coding skills in python.

# How to use PTG ?
PTG receives as an input a Model File that is a text file describing the constraints of your test model as described in [PICTs User Guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/pict/blob/master/doc/pict.md). Simply run PTG.py <filename> in your console in order to generate the test matrix.

# Features

PTG currently features only pairwise combinations and will continue to add more features as the project matures.
